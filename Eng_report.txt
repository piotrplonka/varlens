Summary of the Report: Search for Periodic Variability in Gravitational Microlensing Events

This study analyzes data from the OGLE Early Warning System (EWS) to determine whether microlensed objects exhibit periodic variability, 
suggesting they might be variable stars. The research team divided the observational data into two categories: during microlensing events (IN) and outside of them (OUT). 
The gravitational lensing effect was mathematically corrected using known models, removing amplification and isolating the intrinsic variability of the source.

The study employed Fourier analysis (fnpeaks) and the Analysis of Variance (AOV) method to detect periodic signals in photometric data. 
Additionally, the vartool program was used for periodogram analysis and classification of variable objects. 
Out of approximately 10,000 observed microlensing events, 33 showed periodic variability. 
The periods detected in the IN and OUT datasets were largely consistent, supporting the hypothesis that the sources exhibit genuine periodic changes. 
Future work aims to expand the dataset and refine the classification of variable objects.
